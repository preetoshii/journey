# Journey Page: An Interactive Growth Visualizer

Welcome to the Journey Page, a highly interactive web application that re-imagines personal goal tracking as an animated celestial journey. This project uses the metaphor of a solar system‚Äîa central sun orbited by moons‚Äîto represent a user's core objectives and the progress made towards them. It is a showcase of modern frontend technologies, focusing on sophisticated state management, complex animations, and a polished, engaging user experience.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Dual-View System**: Seamlessly transition between a high-level **Overview Mode** of all goals (moons) and a focused **Detail Mode** for a single goal.
*   **Scroll-Based Navigation**: An intuitive, primary navigation method that uses the scroll wheel to move between the overview and detail views, creating a natural vertical flow.
*   **Accomplishment Cutscenes**: A full-screen animated sequence celebrates major achievements. It features generative "star" particles that journey to the corresponding moon to visually deliver progress.
*   **Advanced Progress Visualization**:
    *   **`ArcProgressBar`**: A custom circular progress bar that animates smoothly to show overall completion of a goal area.
    *   **`SegmentedArcProgressBar`**: A more granular view where each segment of the arc represents a specific sub-goal, providing a detailed breakdown of progress.
*   **Rich, Interactive Animations**: Built with **Framer Motion**, the UI is filled with meaningful micro-interactions, including:
    *   Dynamic, animated SVG backgrounds for each moon that respond to user hover.
    *   Layout animations that smoothly reposition elements between views.
    *   Animated subtitles that cycle through key actions or mantras for each moon.
*   **Centralized State Management**: Powered by **Zustand**, the application state is managed in a single, lightweight store, making complex state transitions (like those in the cutscene) predictable and maintainable.
*   **Comprehensive Debug Mode**: A dedicated debug menu, toggled with the 'D' key, provides powerful keyboard shortcuts for developers to test different states, modes, and animations quickly.

## üéÆ How to Use the Application

1.  **Overview Mode**: You begin in the `Overview`. Here, you see the sun and all its moons. This is your central dashboard.
2.  **Explore a Moon**: Hover over any moon to see its unique animated background and a rotating subtitle that hints at its purpose.
3.  **Enter Detail Mode**: To learn more about a moon, either **scroll down** or **click** on it. This triggers a smooth animated transition into `Detail Mode`.
4.  **View Details**: In `Detail Mode`, the selected moon is featured on one side, while its associated goals and progress appear on the other. The remaining moons are visible as small dots, allowing for quick navigation between them.
5.  **Return to Overview**: To go back to the main dashboard, simply **scroll all the way to the top** of the page.
6.  **Celebrate Achievements**: When a goal is completed, an **Accomplishment Cutscene** will play automatically, providing a visual reward for your progress.
